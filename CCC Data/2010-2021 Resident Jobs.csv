"Description","Industry number and percentages refer to the total and share of workers (aged 16 and over) in an industry, by the residence of the jobholder. CCC generated 5-year estimates and coded this variable to correspond with broader categories outlined by the <a href=""https://www.naics.com/naics-code-description/"" target=""_blank"">North American Industry Classification System</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
""Management and Professional Services"" includes workers in Legal Services, Scientific Research and Development, Architectural and Engineering Services, and other professions which tend to require advanced degrees or certificates.<br />
<br />
""Other Services"" includes workers in Auto Repair and Maintenance, Barber Shops, Beauty Salons, and Religious Organizations, among others.<br />
